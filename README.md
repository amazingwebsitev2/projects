## repurposing
seraph & sl4ckrr is completely open source which allows you to inspect any element of the site on github, as well as being able to download assets for yourself.

*you are 100% allowed to extract games and apps from the site without any credit necessary.* (although it'd still be appreciated!). you can also change around the homepage and any other pages on the site to add or modify content and there will be no fuss from any of us.
JOIN THEIR DISCORDS AND SEND SUPPORT!!!!!!!!

although i dont mind not being credited, please don't just do something as simple as changing the name of the site then replacing any mentions of my name. it's an extremely scummy thing to do, especially if you claim the site as your own creation when there's a lot of effort put in behind the scenes!!

tldr; take anything game/app you want without credit!! add/modify seraph if you want, however don't replace my credit on the actual site if you can
